			<p>If you are going to Bohol for sightseeing and water activities, it's essential to take note of the climate, weather, 
			and temperature before booking your plane tickets. 
			In this section, you'll be able to know the best time of the year to visit Bohol. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Like most regions in the Philippines, the temperature in Bohol varies so little throughout the year. 
			Bohol is hot all year-round. 
			However, the chances of rainfall fluctuate throughout the year.</p>
			<br>
			<p>So you will want to take note and avoid the months with high chances of precipitation, 
			especially if you’re going to make the most out of the beaches and the water activities in Bohol. 
			Additionally, knowing when peak seasons are will help you gauge the amount of crowd you can expect in Bohol tourist spots.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h4 id="Dry">Dry and Summer Season | December to May</h4>
			<br>
			<a href="../../../../IMAGES/GUIDE_IMAGES/BOHOL/2nd.jpg" target="sameWindow">
			<img class="img" src="../../../../IMAGES/GUIDE_IMAGES/BOHOL/2nd.jpg" alt="Island" style="float: left" title="Island">
			</a>
			
			<p>The dry season in Bohol starts in December and ends in May, with April having the least chance of rainfall. 
			Understandably, these months are the peak season; they are the ideal time to visit Bohol for hot-weather activities such as 
			swimming, diving, snorkeling, and sightseeing. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Summer is also the best time to see the Chocolate Hills in their iconic chocolate brown color. 
			Naturally, most travelers prefer visiting Bohol during these months. 
			Which means you can expect to see crowds at Bohol beaches and attractions.</p> 
			<br>
			<h4 id="Holy">Holy Week | March to April </h4>
			<br>
			<a href="../../../../IMAGES/GUIDE_IMAGES/BOHOL/4th.jpg" target="sameWindow">
			<img class="img" src="../../../../IMAGES/GUIDE_IMAGES/BOHOL/4th.jpg" alt="Holyweek" style="float: right" title="Holyweek">
			</a>
			<br>
			<p>The Holy Week falls within the best time range to visit Bohol in terms of weather. 
			Thus, many local visitors flock Bohol's beaches during the months of March to April.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aside from the warm sunny weather, the Holy Week is considered a holiday in the Philippines. 
			You can expect large crowds during this time, a great opportunity to meet and mingle with locals.</p>
			<br>
			<p>If you want to experience the Bohol during the Holy Week, plan a trip from March to April. 
			If you prefer less crowd while still making the best out of the dry season, you can plan your trip in January, February, and May.</p>
			<br>
			<h4 id="Sandugo">Sandugo Festival | July</h4>
			<br>
			<a href="../../../../IMAGES/GUIDE_IMAGES/BOHOL/sandugo.jpg" target="sameWindow">
			<img class="img" src="../../../../IMAGES/GUIDE_IMAGES/BOHOL/sandugo.jpg" alt="Sandugo" style="float: left" title="Sandugo">
			</a>
			<br>
			<p>Every year, Bohol celebrates the Sandugo Festival in Tagbilaran City. 
			The festival commemorates the historic blood compact (Sandugo) between Datu Sikatuna of Bohol and Spanish Conquistador, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. 
			It is a month-long festival that involves beauty pageants and street dancing competitions.</p>
			<br>
			<a href="../../../../IMAGES/GUIDE_IMAGES/BOHOL/sandu1.jpg" target="sameWindow">
			<img class="img3" src="../../../../IMAGES/GUIDE_IMAGES/BOHOL/sandu1.jpg" alt="Festival" style="float: right" title="Festival">
			</a>
			<br>
			<p>If you plan to visit during this time, you will be treated to an immersive cultural experience. 
			As with other Philippine festivals, you can expect the celebration to be vibrant and extravagant. 
			Expect crowded streets and heavy traffic around Tagbilaran City during this festival.</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="Climate">Climate and Weather</h3>
			<br>
			<p>The temperature in Bohol varies very little throughout the year. However, Bohol experiences significant variations in monthly rainfall. 
			The wet season starts from June to November, with June and October receiving the most rain. 
			Whereas, the dry season in Bohol begins in January and ends on May 30, with April having the least chance of rainfall. </p>
			<br>
			<p>To witness the Chocolate Hills in their iconic chocolate brown color, you’ll want to come during the dry months of January through May. 
			Understandably, these months are the peak season, so be ready to compete with the Holy Week crowd.</p>

		<div class = "p">	
			<br>
			<p>Bohol is the prime tourist destination for local and foreign travelers. 
			It is accessible from major cities of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. 
			Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao are the primary island groups of the Philippine archipelago.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Major jump-offs in Luzon include the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, 
			and Clark International Airport in Angeles City, Pampanga. 
			On the other hand, Davao International Airport in Davao City is the primary jump-off in Mindanao.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aside from air travel, you also have the option to travel by sea. 
			You can reach Bohol via fast craft from Cebu, Dumaguete, Siquijor, and Camiguin.</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="Flights"><i class="fas fa-plane"> By Flights</h3></i>

			<br>
			<p>The Bohol-Panglao International Airport services the whole Bohol Province. 
			This airport opened last November 2018. 
			It replaced the old airport that used to be in Tagbilaran City, the capital of Bohol Province.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Bohol-Panglao Airport is dubbed as the “Green Gateway to the World” and the first “Eco-airport 
			in the Philippines” because of its environment-friendly equipment and facilities.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Hence, you might want to book your accommodations in Panglao island itself or start your Bohol 
			adventure in the tourist spots in Panglao for your convenience. 
			If you booked a hotel in Tagbilaran, there is a regular air-conditioned bus from the airport to Island City Mall in Tagbilaran City.</p>
			<br>
			<p>At the moment, Bohol is only connected to domestic destinations. 
			If you are coming from outside of the Philippines, you will have to fly to Luzon or Mindanao to catch a plane to Bohol.</p>
			<br>
			<h4 id="Luzon">From Luzon or Mindanao in the Philippines to Bohol</h4>
			
			<br>
			<blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traveling by air is the most convenient and hassle-free way to reach Bohol. 
			If you’re coming from Luzon, you can fly directly from Ninoy Aquino International Airport  (NAIA) in Manila to the 
			Bohol-Panglao International Airport.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

			<p>Another way to reach Bohol is by traveling by sea. 
			While this route may take longer, you will get to experience a different kind of adventure. 
			Several ferries can take you to Bohol from Cebu, Dumaguete, Siquijor, Cagayan de Oro, and Camiguin.</p>
			<br>
			<p>OceanJet, Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, and Super Shuttle Ferry are the leading ferry companies that 
			travel to Bohol from various locations in Visayas and Mindanao.</p>
			<br>
			<p>OceanJet has daily trips to Bohol from Cebu, Dumaguete, and Siquijor. 
			Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, Cokaliong Shipping Lines, and Lite Ferries have
